# Stack of Iterators

Java conversion of Stack of Iterators Pattern from this blog 
http://garethrees.org/2016/09/28/pattern/

Uses a function to create a closure over an Iterator.

An alternative to recursion
    
  1) lists can grow without limit (recursion will ultimately run out of stack)
  1) Can return at any point without running back through the recursed functions
